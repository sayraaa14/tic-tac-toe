# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s designed to help users play the game in their web browser with basic turn-based gameplay
Overview
I developed this project as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. The goal was to create a fun, interactive web game that demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic. This project also introduced me to the use of audio elements and animations to enhance the user experience.

Features
Turn-based gameplay: Players alternate between "X" and "O".
Win detection: Automatically checks for a winner when a player wins.
Reset button: Resets the game and allows players to start a new match.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure for the game layout and grid.
CSS3: Styling for the game grid, buttons, and animations.
JavaScript: Handles game logic, player turns, win detection, and event listeners.
